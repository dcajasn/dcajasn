I'm Dany from Peru ðŸ‡µðŸ‡ª, I studied economic engineering and I have a master in finance. I learned to programming by myself because I like to applied finance theory to real problems. My hobbies are workout at home, play video games, listen metal music, read about quantitative finance and programming applied to finance.

### Projects

- __[Riskfolio-Lib](https://github.com/dcajasn/Riskfolio-Lib):__ a python library for quantitative portfolio optimization.
- __Riskfolio.jl:__ is a julia version of Riskfolio-Lib, now is in development. It is my excuse to learn Julia.
- __[Financioneroncios](http://financioneroncios.wordpress.com/):__ my personal blog where I share python examples applied to finance, mostly in my native language (spanish).

### Publications

I'm not an academic but I wrote three working papers based on the mathematics that I needed to build Riskfolio-Lib:

- __[Robust Portfolio Selection with Near Optimal Centering](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3572435):__ is a method that allows to increase robustness and diversification of portfolios.
- __[Entropic Portfolio Optimization: a Disciplined Convex Programming Framework](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3792520):__ is a discretization of Entropic Value at Risk and Entropic Drawdown at Risk that allows us to use softwares that supports disciplined convex programming.
- __[Kelly Portfolio Optimization: a Disciplined Convex Programming Framework](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3833617):__ is a generalization of Kelly criterion that allows us to built Logarithmic Mean Risk Optimal Portfolios.
